#Here are the inputs which basically allows the user to interact with the program and type in the name for the Hero and his pet plus the villain aswell.
heroName = input("Enter the name of the Hero: ")

#The empty print spaces are made so that you can see where the story ends and starts without seeing all the inputs right next to the information.

#Here is the story. '+' will basically connect multiple things together such as the input for the villains name which should show right next to the text.
print(" There was once an evil man named " + villainName)
#\n will create a new line so when you see that it means it will start a new line.
print(" he was believed to be unstoppable until a great hero named " + heroName + "\n and his trusty pet " + heroPetName + " who appeared out of no where came to save the day.")
#Here is another space to make it clearer as to where the story ends, it's completely optional and can be removed if you want to.
